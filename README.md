 Automatically searches and visits random rooms throughout your Hotel. 
 
# [Explanation]
This extension does 3 things:
 1. Tries to generate 50(keep this value in mind) random rooms. Checks for validity (room exists + room is open(no doorbell/password)).
 2. Starts visiting them after x amount of seconds, this depends on the 50 value. If you change it to a higher value, you will need to wait longer.
 3. When your list of rooms (Total rooms found) reaches under 2, the extension will start again with step #1 so you don't need to do anything.

The variable 50 can be changed, I've done this on purpose because not everyone has a great pc or internet.
The next rule applies: If you have fast internet, you can set the value higher. If you're having a lot of issues with your internet, i advice you to set it under 50. 

 # [Warning!]
 Don't try to set the value higher than 500 as the habbo servers will give you a temporary cool-down period of 15-30 minutes. In this period you won't be able to log in. 
 
 
# How to use:
 1. Start extension
 2. Click START
 3. Let the extension do it's work (about 10 seconds, depends if you changed the '50' value).
 4. Want to stop ? Click on STOP
